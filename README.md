## Expectations for people in the Soft Robots Lab

Science is hard. There can be more failures than successes, and we may need to pivot multiple times before finding something that works. In this lab, we strive for the challenges to come from the science, not from the environment. Everyone should be able to engage with science in a hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding professional lab environment.

In general, I expect you to:

* Keep up-to-date documentation on your project
* Be engaged within the research group and with outside colleagues (as appropriate for your project)
* Treat your lab mates, lab funds, equipment, and your time with respect
* Work hard -- don’t give up!
* Be kind -- but [Radically Candid](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) rather than Ruinously Empathetic
* Take care of yourself mentally and physically

### You will take ownership over your training experience
* Ensure that you meet regularly with the professor and provide updates on the progress and results of your activities and experiments.
* Be knowledgeable of the policies, deadlines, and requirements of the program and the university. Comply with all institutional policies, including academic program milestones, laboratory practices, and rules related to lab safety
* Build your mentoring team. Everyone needs many mentors with diverse perspectives throughout their career. Once you recognize my strengths and deficiencies as a mentor, seek out additional formal and informal mentors to help you achieve your goals. Seek out diverse mentors: peer mentors, mentors with a shared background, mentors inside & outside of academia. Also, seek out mentees as well. We can grow both by mentoring and being mentored.

### You will be a team player
* Attend and actively participate in all group meetings. Engage with your colleagues during these meetings as well as discussing your own work with me. A big part of the reason why we try to meet with so many people at once is so that you all can make connections with each other and learn what everyone else is doing. Do your part to create a climate of engagement and mutual respect.
* When folks are new, keep an eye out for whether they are struggling. Not everyone is comfortable interrupting others, so ask newbies if there is anything they need help with.
* Concerns over authorship, ownership, acknowledging contributions, experimental data etc., should be discussed early and often with all parties.
* Be respectful, tolerant of, and work collegially with all of your lab mates: respect differences in values, personalities, work styles, and perspectives.

⮞ You will develop strong research skills
✔ Maintain detailed, organized, and accurate laboratory records. You will maintain an electronic lab notebook using the Box cloud service. Your notes should allow your work to be reproduced (meaning they must be understandable by people other than yourself). To write grants to support your work, I need to be able to easily find and understand your data. Be aware that your notes, records and all tangible research data, including sequences and analyses, are property of the lab. When you leave the lab, I encourage you to take copies of your data with you, but one full set of all data/files/notes must stay in the lab, with appropriate and clear documentation. Early in your tenure, I will audit your laboratory notes to ensure you are recording and organizing your data well. Please remind me if I forget. Regularly backup your computer data. For more detailed guidelines, see the "Box Electronic Lab Notebook" section below.

✔ Critically analyze your data in a timely fashion. You will analyze your data shortly after it is collected. This includes performing any mathematical normalizations or conversions and graphically representing the data in a publishable format (using Graphpad Prism or R if graphpad is incapable of doing the visualization). I expect you to critique the data -- did the experiment perform as expected? Is your experiment giving similar to results obtained previously in the lab as shown in our publications and electronic lab notebooks? If you are not sure about the data, please bring it up to me and labmates ASAP, so that we can set priorities for troubleshooting.

✔ Keep up with the literature so that you can have a hand in guiding your own research. Block at least one hour per week to read papers. You are expected to keep on top of both current and past literature related to your project. Because of the volume of individual research projects in the lab and my other teaching and administrative duties, I do not have the bandwidth to be on top of all of the literature for everyone’s project—I expect you to be the expert! Please forward me papers you come across that you think are particularly relevant, and I will do the same. To help yourself, set up keyword searches through PubMed or Google Scholar alerts. Consider using Twitter professionally (following scientists & contributing to public discource), but make sure it doesn't distract you from your work. Also, make sure that Twitter/science social media does not detract from your mental health. If you are struggling with your project, Twitter can amplify negative feelings.

✔ Prepare scientific articles that effectively present your work to others in the field. The ‘currency’ in science is published papers, and we have an obligation to funding agencies to complete and disseminate our findings. I will push you to publish your research as you move through your training program, not only at the end. PhD students will be expected to be lead author on at least 2 research manuscripts. Time and opportunity permitting, consider adapting the introduction to your PhD thesis into a Review / MiniReview. Similarly, postdocs should aim for at least 2-3 first author papers. We will deposit all our manuscripts on a preprint server like BioRxiv at the same time as we submit them to a peer-reviewed journal. We will identify journals/publishing companies that are consistent with the lab's values (e.g. we will favor Society journals [ASM, APS, ASPB] and open access journals [PLoS, eLife, PeerJ] and avoid for-profit publishers like Elsevier, MDPI, and FrontiersIn.

✔ Acknowledge that performing experiments and using lab resources is a privilege. Scientists have to be careful. Don't rush your work. Plan it. Organize it. If performing a new protocol, walk through the steps. Everyone makes mistakes and gets overwhelmed, however, if your records and analyses are not getting the attention needed to ensure reproducibility then your use of lab resources will be put on hold.

⮞ You will communicate clearly
✔ Remember that all of us are “new” at many points in our careers. If you feel uncertain, overwhelmed, or want additional support, please overtly ask for it. Our lab welcomes these conversations and views them as necessary. Build community within the lab and reinforce this philosophy with new and existing lab members. Make folks comfortable with asking you for help.

✔ Include Tiffany on all communications regarding lab research (yours or others). This includes cc'ing me on emails and making me aware of any conversations outside of email. It helps me stay in the loop.

✔ Let me know the style of communication or schedule of meetings that you prefer. If there is something about my mentoring style that is proving difficult for you, please tell me so that you give me an opportunity to find an approach that works for you. No single style works for everyone; no one style is expected to work all the time. That said, understand that I am also human, and I also have preferred styles of communication.

Do not skip meetings with me if you feel that you have not made adequate progress on your research; these might be the most critical times to meet.

✔ Communicate your data with integrity. It is never okay to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or otherwise fudge results. We don't generate data to prove our favorite hypothesis. We perform science to find out the truth by forming testable hypotheses and rigorously and critically testing the hypotheses.

### Cleaning

* Participate in lab cleanup at the end of every semester.
* At the end of every meeting with the professor, both you and the professor must pick up one tool and put it away. 

### Sharing resources

* Use laboratory resources carefully and frugally. If a shared supply is running out, let the professor know. 
* Expect to share equipment and materials with your colleagues. Do not put items which may be useful to multiple people away into a project box for your own use only without discussing it with the professor.
