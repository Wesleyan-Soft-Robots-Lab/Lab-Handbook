# Soft Robots Lab Handbook

This handbook describes the expectations for members of the Wesleyan Soft Robots lab. It will tell you about the values, mission, goals, and objectives of the group. It also provides helpful information to help you get started in the lab. Many of the questions you have about getting started in the lab will initially be answered with "Have you checked the lab handbook?". This is a living document that will continue to change. If you notice that there is any information missing that you think is important for getting started or operating on a day-to-day basis in the lab, let the professor know, and we will add it to the handbook. 

This handbook takes inspiration from the [Low-Power](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/lab_handbook), [Olanrewaju](https://ayokunle.notion.site/Lab-Manual-739058eaa0da4ab6bc8f6c310f896426), and [Barber](https://www.annikabarberlab.com/barber-lab-manual) lab handbooks.

## Values

Here are some guiding principles and standards that we hold dear and that inform our work and approach to the world:
1. We value people over projects and cultivate a collaborative community.
2. We believe failure is a natural part of learning and celebrate not just our positive results but also our initial attempts, ongoing efforts, and failed strategies. Failure is *information*!
3. We embrace fast and frugal prototyping approaches that both allow us to test our understanding and theories, and make science more accessible to people who couldn't otherwise afford to get involved.
4. We seek projects and problems with potential to have a positive impact on human lives, and carefully consider how we want to be involved in projects that have potential to have a negative impact on human lives. 

## Expectations for people in the Soft Robots Lab

Science is hard. There can be more failures than successes, and we may need to pivot multiple times before finding something that works. In this lab, we strive for the challenges to come from the science, not from the environment. Everyone should be able to engage with science in a hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding professional lab environment.

In general, I expect you to:

* Keep up-to-date documentation on your project
* Be engaged within the research group and with outside colleagues (as appropriate for your project)
* Treat your lab mates, lab space, lab funds, equipment, and your time with respect
* Work hard -- donâ€™t give up! When you encounter an obstacle, try to solve it yourself before asking the professor for next steps
* Be kind -- but [Radically Candid](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) rather than Ruinously Empathetic
* Take care of yourself mentally and physically

### Expectation: You will take ownership over your training experience

* Ensure that you meet regularly with the professor and provide updates on the progress and results of your activities and experiments.
* Be knowledgeable of the policies, deadlines, and requirements of the program and the university. Comply with all institutional policies, including academic program milestones, laboratory practices, and rules related to lab safety
* Build your mentoring team. Everyone needs many mentors with diverse perspectives throughout their career. Once you recognize my strengths and deficiencies as a mentor, seek out additional formal and informal mentors to help you achieve your goals. Seek out diverse mentors: peer mentors, mentors with a shared background, mentors inside & outside of academia. Also, seek out mentees as well. We can grow both by mentoring and being mentored.

### Expectation: You will be a team player

* Attend and actively participate in all group meetings. Engage with your colleagues during these meetings as well as discussing your own work with me. A big part of the reason why we try to meet with so many people at once is so that you all can make connections with each other and learn what everyone else is doing. Do your part to create a climate of engagement and mutual respect.
* When folks are new, keep an eye out for whether they are struggling. Not everyone is comfortable interrupting others, so ask newbies if there is anything they need help with.
* Concerns over authorship, ownership, acknowledging contributions, experimental data etc., should be discussed early and often with all parties.
* Be respectful, tolerant of, and work collegially with all of your lab mates: respect differences in values, personalities, work styles, and perspectives.

### Expectation: You will develop strong research skills

* Maintain detailed, organized, and accurate records of your work.
* Your notes should allow your work to be reproduced (meaning they must be understandable by people other than yourself).
* Be aware that your notes, records and all tangible research data, including sequences and analyses, are property of the lab. This is why all GitHub repositories must be made through the Wesleyan Soft Robots Lab organization, and why all data must be uploaded to the Google drive. When you leave the lab, I encourage you to take copies of your data with you, but one full set of all data/files/notes must stay in the lab, with appropriate and clear documentation. 

### Expectation: You must acknowledge that using lab resources is a privilege

* Scientists have to be careful. Don't rush your work. Plan and organize it carefully. If performing a new protocol or using a new piece of equipment, ask for help and walk through the steps. Everyone makes mistakes and gets overwhelmed. However, if you are consistently damaging lab equipment, failing to document your work, or not consistently engaging with the lab, you will not be allowed to continue in the lab. 

### Expectation: You will communicate clearly

* Remember that all of us are "new" at many points in our careers. If you feel uncertain, overwhelmed, or want additional support, please overtly ask for it. Our lab welcomes these conversations and views them as necessary. Build community within the lab and reinforce this philosophy with new and existing lab members. Make folks comfortable with asking you for help.

### Expectation: All lab-related communication happens through the lab Discord

### Expectation: Communicate your data with integrity
* It is never okay to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or otherwise fudge results. We don't generate data to prove our favorite hypothesis. We perform science to find out the truth by forming testable hypotheses and rigorously and critically testing the hypotheses.
